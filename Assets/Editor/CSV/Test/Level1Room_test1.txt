Conversation	MagUnet meets Redgie	"Hello there, didn’t realize there was anyone else down here.;We’ll exchange pleasantries later. First, let’s get out of here.;That puddle of blue paint will give you pulling powers.;It’ll allow you to pull me down from here.;I’ll sit on the pressure plate and unlock the elevator.;"
Remark	"Redgie gets pulled by MagUnets powers"	"See that? That’s not just paint. That’s power, baby!"
Conversation	"When the exit door is opened and the level is completed"	"Well done! One step closer to getting out of here.;Name’s Redgie. Red block. Big voice. Impeccable sitting abilities.;Engraving on your side says MagUnet, I’ll call you that.;We’re in the Scrap well station, the lowest factory level.;Rock bottom means we can’t fall, we’ll only rise.;"
